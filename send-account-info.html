  After you have these two accounts,
  <a
    href="https://forms.gle/MRQyfhw7roTnLCX89"
    >fill out and submit the beginning-of-semester survey form</a
  >. We need this so that we can give you access to the private GitHub
  organization that we have set up for this class, add you to the class Slack
  channel -- and to find out more about you!
</p>

<p>
  (That's the same survey linked from the course home page; you don't need to
  submit it twice, obviously.)

<div class="reminder urgent">
  ⚠️ Use the above form and then select the button below to proceed.

<button
  class="action-btn action-btn-enabled"
