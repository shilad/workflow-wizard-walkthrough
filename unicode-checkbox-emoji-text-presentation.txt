There's some interesting UTF-8 combining character stuff here, I think:

☑ ️Register Code as an editor for supported file types

Now delete the second character in that line, which displays as a wide
space, even though emacs' C-x = says it's a regular space: you see a
shaded, filled-in checkmark box:

☑️Register Code as an editor for supported file types

OTOH, start with the above. With point on R, backspace 3 times. No more
spaces and same checkbox. But in the original, going forward it's only 2!

☑Register Code as an editor for supported file types

Why? See below: the second character in the first line is a space
(0x20), and the third is the "emoji presentation" code point U+fe0f.
That makes the space get shown here as wider than usual. Delete the
space, and now the emoji presentation code point applies to the checkbox.

Code points in "☑ ️R":

U+2611    U+20   U+fe0f U+52
checkbox  space  emoji  'R'

Encoded in UTF-8 as:

e2 98 91  32     ef b8 8f  52
checkbox  space  emoji     'R'

So if there's no U+fe0f or U+fe0e, it's text presentation.

For the emoji-fied version "☑️R", code points are

U+2611 U+fe0f U+52

encoded as bytes

e2 98 91 ef b8 8f 52

Emacs says the checkbox (regardless of how it's displayed) is 0x2611,
"ballot box with check".

"FEOF can be slapped after a symbol - without a ZWJ! - to indicate that
the preceding codepoint should be interpreted for Emoji Presentation,
and not textual mode - her sister, U+FE0E, does that. If you want to see
this in action: [⚧︎⚧️] is [U+26A7 U+FE0E U+26A7 U+FEOF]. Same codepoint,
two render modes!"

And sure enough, if you do the same with the checkbox U+2611, you get
the above behavior: put U+2611 U+fe0e U+2611 U+fe0f into

Emoji presentation checkbox is U+2611 U+fe0f, encoded into UTF-8 as
